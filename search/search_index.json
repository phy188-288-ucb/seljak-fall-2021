Scopatz and K. D. Huff From Python to Numpy by N. P. Rougier Other resources will be provided according to the needs. Software We will use Python Jupyter hub environment. You are expected to use existing numerical analysis routines and not write your own. Most of these are already implemented in python libraries (scipy, numpy...). Homeworks and Projects Throughout the course, students will complete and electronically submit one homework assignment (code) per week. This code will be run on test cases to check if it produces appropriate results. Students are encouraged to discuss homeworks with other students, but should submit their own solutions. Homeworks will use the concepts developed in the lectures and apply to relatively simple problems. Projects are larger assignments intended to teach you how to combine ideas from the course in interesting ways and apply them to real data. There are three projects during the semester. You are encouraged to complete projects in pairs; your partner should be another student in your section. Work together to ensure that both group members understand the complete program you create. Homeworks and projects are to be submitted using Jupyter notebook in Python. Sample projects: 1) Planck satellite data analysis : use measurement of Planck satellite power spectrum to determine cosmological parameters. First use linear algebra to solve the least square problem and find MAP/MLE best fit parameters. Next use optimization to solve for the same. Determine covariances of all parameters using Laplace approximation. Make predictions for future experiments with lower noise using Fisher matrix experiment design predictions. Use Planck published MCMC chains and analyze their burn-in phase, Gelman-Rubin statistics, and chain correlations. Plot their 1-d and 2-d distributions and compare them to MAP/Laplace approximation. Change one parameter and use importance sampling to produce new posteriors. 2) LIGO Nobel prize data analysis : use matched filtering methods and FFT to analyze first LIGO event and show it has detected gravitational waves. 3) Machine learning on galaxies : use SDSS galaxy flux photometric measurements and redshift measurements to train the ML algorithms for regression, determining the redshift. Use verification data to test the training algorithms. Try KNN, gaussian processes, linear and quadratic regression, support vector machines, neural networks, random forest... Next try classification: use galaxy zoo galaxy morphology (spirals ellipticals, irregulars...) training data and apply to SDSS. Use photometry first, then add image information and observe how the accuracy improves.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#bayesian-data-analysis-and-machine-learning-for-physical-sciences","text":"Instructor: Uro\u0161 Seljak, useljak@berkeley.edu Office hours: TBD GSI: Adrian Bayer, abayer@berkeley.edu Office hours: TBD Lecture: Tuesday, Thursday 9:30AM-11:00AM, North Gate 105 Discussion: Wednesday 1:00PM-2:00PM, Wheeler 204 or Wednesday 5:00PM-6:00PM, Cory 241 Units: 4.0 Class Number: 25131","title":"Bayesian Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Physical Sciences"},{"location":"#course-syllabus","text":"Learning goals : The goals of the course is to get acquainted with modern computational methods used in physical sciences, including numerical analysis methods, data science and Bayesian statistics.
